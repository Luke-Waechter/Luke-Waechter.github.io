							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/squad.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Michigan - Go Blue! Some of the upper level courses I took include Game Design, Web Design, Programming Paradigms, and Operating Systems! I especially loved my Game Design course and hope to one day find a job within the industry. I love to put smiles on other peoples faces, and some of the most meaningful moments in my life came from gaming with friends. I'd love to give that experience to others!</p>
							<p>When I'm not working on new coding projects, I spend my free time in a variety of different ways, but you will most often find me running, cooking, gaming, or goofing off with my friends. I've been a runner since sixth grade and I don't plan on stopping any time soon, I peaked competitively in high school, but have since transitioned into running to relax, rather than compete. As for cooking, my specialties are anything involving meat, I'm a wizard on the grill, a skill I picked up working at my local diner for 5 years. And when it comes to gaming, I'll play anything, but I especially love to play card games! Magic the Gathering, Slay the Spire, Hearthstone, and more all have a special place in my heart.</p>
