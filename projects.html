							<p>I've implemented many projects in my courses at the Univeristy of Michigan that I can't share directly, including but not limited to:</p>
                            <ul class="old proj">
                                <li>A Euchre Simulator - Programmed in C++, simulated using Classes and Standard Input/Output</li>
                                <li>A Search Engine - A scalable search engine using TF-IDF and PageRank to retrieve relevant documents based on queries. During this project, I also implemented a Mapreduce framework that assigns mapping and reducing tasks to workers</li>
                                <li>A Full Stack Web App - A full-stack application using Flask that simulates the core features of Instagram. Featuring dynamic interactions between server and user, such as user authentication, account handling, and creating/liking posts; deployed to AWS. During this project I also created client side interactions using the React framework, such as infinite scrolling for new content and posting comments without the need to refresh the page</li>
                                <li>As well as many exploratory projects such as A Pipelined Datapath Simulator, Creating and Managing Hash Tables Through User Composition, Implementation of Optimization Algorithms, and more</li>
                            </ul>
							<p>The projects I CAN share with you however are found below!</p>

							<h3>Metroid NES Remake</h3>
                            <p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/Metroid.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            I recreated a portion of the classic NES game Metroid as part of a team, as well as designing and implementing a custom mechanic, and a level to explore its use cases. My specialities for this project included: Custom level design, enemy behavior, inventory system design, health management, and other miscelaneous tasks.

							<h3>Black Hole in One</h3>
                            <p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/BHI1_2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            For our rapid prototyping project, limited to onlly two weeks, I built a casual physics based golf game called Black Hole in One! The main features of this game include: Planetary gravity, level transition mechanics, animation in Unity, level design, and EventBus tracking.
